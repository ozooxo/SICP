This is the solution set of Cong-Xin Qiu for the book `"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"`_.

Most of the files in this repository are debugged using Racket v5.3.1. Section 3.4 is just a written solution, as ``(make-serializer)`` and ``parallel-execute`` are undefined. Most solutions in Chapter 4 (except ``4_16b``, ``4_20a``, ``4_20b``, ``4_21a``, ``4_21b``) haven't been tested or debugged in any way.
