This is the solution set of Cong-Xin Qiu for the book `"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"`_.

Most of the files in this repository are debugged using Racket v5.3.1. Section 3.4 is just a written solution, as ``(make-serializer)`` and ``parallel-execute`` are undefined. Exercise ``3.73`` haven't been further tested, because of a lack of reasonable data streams; and ``3.77``, because even for the book example, I still cannot let ``delay`` and ``force`` run with no error in Racket. Most solutions in Chapter 4 (except ``4.16(b)``, ``4.20(a)``, ``4.20(b)``, ``4.21(a)``, ``4.21(b)``) haven't been tested or debugged in any way.
